# Jenkins GitOps Kubernetes Repository

Welcome to the Jenkins GitOps Kubernetes repository! This repository contains the Kubernetes deployment and service manifests necessary for deploying applications using Jenkins in a GitOps workflow.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find deployment and service manifests that define how applications are deployed and exposed within a Kubernetes cluster. These manifests are managed and updated automatically through Jenkins pipelines, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

## Getting Started

To get started with deploying applications using Jenkins and Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure Jenkins Pipeline:** Set up Jenkins to trigger pipelines based on changes to this repository. Refer to our [medium article](https://medium.com/@sameeradissanayaka/building-a-robust-ci-cd-pipeline-with-jenkins-docker-kubernetes-and-argocd-bdcc15a31a2f) for detailed instructions on setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and ArgoCD.

3. **Update Manifests:** Customize the deployment and service manifests according to your application requirements. Ensure that the paths and image references are correctly configured.

4. **Commit Changes:** Once you've made the necessary changes to the manifests, commit them to this repository.

5. **Monitor Deployment:** Jenkins will automatically detect changes in this repository and trigger pipeline jobs to deploy your applications to the Kubernetes cluster. Monitor the pipeline execution and deployment status in Jenkins.
